# DarkestNight
Darkest Night
Ryan Sobczak

Background:
You are a lone survivor in Godforsken City. 
It was given that name after all the citizens became the "Unspeakables".
You have one goal, to survive until help comes. That is if help every comes.
During the day you learn where the Unseakables will emerge from. 
Set up the barricades to protect your house. 
At night they will appear at try to attack your house.
At night you can also set up barricades to try to stop them, 
but all building costs are more.
When your available resources equal zero, you can build anything. 
Each new day you are rewarded with some resources, so be smart and don't die.
